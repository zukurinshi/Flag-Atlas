  overview:
    "Flags have been a symbol of identity, communication, and unity for centuries. Their origins date back to ancient civilizations, where colorful banners and cloths were used to signify tribal allegiances, military units, or religious ceremonies. In ancient Egypt and Rome, flags served as standards carried into battle, often adorned with symbols representing gods, emperors, or cultural icons. During the Middle Ages, heraldic flags emerged, showcasing intricate designs that identified noble families and knights on the battlefield. As maritime exploration expanded, national flags began to fly on ships to indicate their country of origin, fostering the rise of the modern nation-state.<br><br>" +
    " Flags have evolved from basic identifiers into intricate designs reflecting political, cultural, and historical significance. Each element on a flag—be it a color, symbol, or geometric pattern—has specific meanings rooted in historical contexts or national narratives. For instance, the tricolor design, popularized during the French Revolution, became a model for modern nation-states seeking to convey values like liberty and equality. Beyond nations, flags are used to designate naval fleets, international organizations, and even territories, governed by protocols such as those outlined in vexillology. Today, flags serve as practical tools for communication and enduring symbols of unity, often representing centuries of history and collective identity.",
  vexillology:
    "Vexillology, derived from the Latin word vexillum (meaning 'flag') and the Greek suffix -logia (study), is the scholarly discipline dedicated to the study of flags. It encompasses the design, symbolism, and history of flags, as well as their usage and cultural significance. While its formal recognition as a field of study is relatively modern, interest in flags dates back centuries, with early civilizations using banners and standards to signify allegiance, authority, or identity.<br><br>" +
    "Vexillology explores the meaning behind flag design elements like colors, patterns, and symbols. Red often signifies bravery, green symbolizes growth, and stars or crescents reflect ideological or religious influences. Vexillologists study how flags evolve with geopolitical shifts and cultural changes, examining their role in history. Beyond national flags, the field also covers maritime ensigns, regional emblems, and organizational banners, including protocols for proper use and display. By collaborating with historians and designers, vexillologists highlight how flags act as symbols of identity, unity, and power.",
